# TypeScript Front-End Refactoring

# Background
This problem simulates a scenario where a Junior developer has submitted a pull-request for an "AuthenticaitonManager" class.  The class is designed to handle the authentication of a user in a front end web application.  The main features are that a user can login with a username and password.  Upon login a session token will be returned which is stored in local storage so that the user remains logged in across page refreshes.  The AuthenticaitonManager can tell you if a user is currently logged in or not, and also allows a currently logged in user to logout.

# Directions
Assume that this class was submitted to you in a PR.  

  * Think about how would you review the code?
  * Refactor the code to clean it up, however you see fit.
  * Come prepared to provide feedback on the code (as if your interviewer was the developer who submitted the code).
  * Walk the interiewer through why you refactored it the way you did.

Feel free to ask any calrifying questions you like along the way.
